     and warehousing.<br> A wide variety of goods are handled and stored, such as paper from SCA, tomato paste from Orkla Foods Sweden,

    <h3>Keep track of the units</h3><br>
    <p>We always offer you the possibility to keep track of your units – information on each stage of the containers journey and whether 
       the time frames are kept. With the PORTit system, we and our customers can follow freight traffic in real-time.
       Through wireless communication between trucks, hand-held terminals, tallymen, and the port’s central IT system,
       the container information is transmitted at the same moment as a physical transfer takes place. 
       The information is published simultaneously in the portal for tracing units, where you can follow and trace all containers.<br>
