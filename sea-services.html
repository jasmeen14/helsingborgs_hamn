        <p>The Port of Helsingborg is a multifaceted hub that offers exceptional opportunities for efficient train,
        road, and sea transports throughout the entire logistics chain. Though we’re the largest port for fruit transports
        in the Nordic,as well as a master of ferry traffic, we’re probably most well-known as a container specialist –
        and for many years, this is our main focus.</p>

        <aside>
        <p>Featuring more than 400 reefer outlets for refrigerated containers, 
            the Port of Helsingborg offers safe and secure handling of fruit and vegetables.

  <div class="desc1"><ins><b>Container Traffic</b></ins><br>
    When transporting goods between continents worldwide, loading containers on cargo ships is the most efficient way.
     Containers arriving at or departing from the Port of Helsingborg normally come from a transoceanic port of transshipment, 
     such as Hamburg, Rotterdam, or Antwerpen goods are transhipped to smaller feeder vessels. 
     Every week some 15 ships from around ten companies call to the Port of Helsingborg as part of their scheduled routes. 
     The heavy traffic is beneficial for the import and export industry and the transport business in our entire region.

    <div class="desc1"><ins><b> Traffic Bulk</b></ins><br>
     Bulk is basically anything that is transported in large quantities without packaging or packing, like grains, oil, or pellets.
      In the Port of Helsingborg, we have long experience in handling for example large volumes of pellets for Öresundskraft
       (local energy supplier). While volumes of mineral oils are handled by our customers in the Energy Terminal, grain volumes 
       are handled in the Grains Terminal by Lantmännen.

       <div class="desc1"><ins><b>Ferry and Cruise Traffic</b></ins><br>
       The ferries between Helsingborg and Helsingør work as a bridge for passengers, cargo trucks, and cars. To ”tura” 
       (catching the ferry back and forth several times in a row while enjoying good food and drinks) is a well-known leisure activity
        in Helsingborg and very popular among tourists. The ferry traffic between Helsingborg and Helsingor continues to be one of the 
        port’s busiest areas. While the main operator is ForSea with five ferries, passengers can also take the M/S Pernille operated 
        by Sundbusserne.
